Resources To Help Computer Savvy Preachers Automate their Preaching Work


There are some very niche cases I have come across in my line as both a Computer Engineer working as a part time Certified Lay Minister in the UMC where I have found my programming abilities helpful in automating tasks so we can focus on serving people in the church on meaningful things, not on administrative tasks. 

So far, most of my work is just in making some Zapier Tasks to post Youtube Videso to Facebook, but I am also using Regexes to process the RCL readings I know I use consistently (The Old Testament Non Psalm Reading and Gospel reading) from the RCL to post to Facebook weekly. 

So to help other preachers who are tech savvy, I am posting these resources here, it's also to help me not lose track of my work. I can't say its going to be in any way accessible, you need to be programmnig inclined, and familiar with an automation tool like Zapier or equivalent to use these. But I hope you find them useful all the same.
